    <h4>Kerala Folklore Museum</h4>
    <p>I am interested in the arts.
    The folklore museum in Kerala is famous for providing art education to students and visual knowledge to art lovers and researchers.
    It treasures the trove of stone, sculptures, stone Age objects, jewelry, paintings, musical instruments, and folk art.
    This ethnic museum has the essence of life and culture over the past 1000 years.</p>
    <b>I believe that Creativity is contagious. Art is not what we see, but what we make others see.</b>
